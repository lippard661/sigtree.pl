28 September 2025: 1.20b: Add "devpts" to nonstandard fs type list,
	don't run create_tree or fork children for unnecessary sets when
	-s is used, add exception to Linux config for /dev/core to ignore.
20 September 2025: 1.20a: Use full references for PGP::Sign and add
	linux.sigtree.conf
13 September 2025: 1.19h: Only load PGP::Sign/Signify when needed,
	don't use Linux runlevel for checking immutable capability,
	don't use lsattr on character special files or files on fuse,
	msdos, or other non-standard filesystems. Updated README.
6 September 2025: 1.19g: set fork_children=0 for initialize_specs.
27 August 2025: 1.19f: sanitize environment, avoid shell in system calls.
21 December 2024: 1.19e: unveil sigtree dirs with rwxc.
12 October 2024: 1.19d: expand unveil to /.
1 September 2024: 1.19c: fix Linux immutability issues.
30 August 2024: 1.19b: fix immutable_file/_get_file_flags bugs.
14 August 2024: 1.19a: -f option for number of child processes, config
	options for max_child_procs and default_child_procs, -m for
	macOS to not show contents of macOS applications, fixed bug
	in filename escaping for immutable flag collection.
10 August 2024: 1.19: Fork children to speed up check and initialize.
	Use Signify.pm and OpenBSD::MkTemp.
7 January 2024: 1.18d: Minor bug fixes in error messages and signify
	signature creation. Use Storable built-in locking.
30 December 2023: 1.18c: Call pledge correctly, not require pgpkeyid when
	using signify.
16 December 2023: 1.18b: Fix bug for OpenBSD: unveil /tmp. Oops.
9 December 2023: 1.18a: Fix unveil for commands to be rx, not x.
3 December 2023: 1.18: Added pledge and unveil for OpenBSD;
	updated config file to not monitor pflog, just pflog.txt
18 October 2023: 1.17d: Continue instead of aborting when fileattr cannot
	be retrieved.
23 January 2022: 1.17c: Fixed all edge cases of the display issue and an
	update issue for extraneous files.
23 January 2022: 1.17b: Removed paren escaping, unnecessary and wrong.
	Fixed a minor cosmetic display issue (added an extra blank line after
	found extraneous files).
22 January 2022: 1.17a: Fix "$" escape, remove extraneous stuff from
	changed file and be more careful about update_sets trying to
	use changed file trees that are no longer in the config.
20 January 2022: 1.17: Escape "$" char in commands to get immutable flags,
	fix error message for signing key-related fields when specified
	file can't be read (change made shortly after 1.16 release).
	Also re-implement escaping of parens from 2012. Warn about
	extraneous files (not in config) in specification dir for check
	commands, remove extraneous files from specification dir for
	initialize/update commands. Allow initialize to use
	-s option with a set name "new" or "uninitialized" to
	initialize all uninitialized trees in the config. Make "new" and

	README file a long-overdue update.
28 July 2021: 1.16: Added signify as alternative to PGP/GPG.

17 November 2017: 1.12: Bug fixes in flag handling, default config for macOS.
10 October 2015: 1.11: Added SHA-3 and made it the default. Added
	sha3_digest keyword to config, shadigest/sha3digest keyword for sets.
	The internal storage of SHA digests has changed incompatibly,
	requiring all existing specs to be reinitialized.
24 March 2014: 1.11 (still unreleased): Split out tree for /usr/X11R6
	into /usr/X11R6/bin and /usr/X11R6/lib.
30 March 2013: 1.11 Changed CRIT-LOG definition to use mtimestasis-24h,
	and added it to authlog, daemon, lastlog, maillog, messages,
	and secure.
25 March 2013: 1.10 Added mtimestasis-\d{1,2}[smhd] keyword, which
	reports on mtime failure to change for more than \d{1,2}
	seconds/minutes/hours/days.
19 November 2012: 1.9 Fix double error message for nonexistent
	exception-trees, plus typo in error message/inadvertent
	lowercasing of line. Added new secondary sets system (SYS) and
	user (USER) to default config file.
10 November 2012: 1.9 Will die if hostname is undefined.
3 November 2012: 1.8 Using Digest::SHA instead of Digest::SHA1 and
	Digest::SHA2. Removed sha_digest configuration keyword, replaced
	it with sha2_digest keyword which allows values of 256, 384, and 512.
25 December 2011: 1.7 Repackaged the tarball to make it work better as
	an OpenBSD port/package, changed default location of sigtree.pl
	and sigtree.conf, fixed bug in &verify_required_dirs to allow
	creation of new specs when using immutable flag, added option to
	use either system or user immutable flags on BSD, fixed bug in
	&is_immutable that had BSD and Linux options switched.  Default
	location of config file is now /etc/<hostname>.sigtree.conf,
	default location of specs is now /var/db/sigtree.
23 December 2011: 1.6a Repackaged the tarball to make it work better
	as an OpenBSD port/package, changed default location of sigtree.pl
	and sigtree.conf.
23 November 2008: 1.6 Modified to not create trees in sets marked ignore and
	to compute SHA1/SHA2 digests based on keywords in primary set rather
	than based on the global configuration sha_digest field, which is now
	ignored.
5 March 2005: 1.5 Added sha_digest field to global section of config file;
	added support for SHA2 digests (instead of or in addition to SHA1
	digests).
3 September 2004: 1.4a Test for $self->{LINKTARGET_TYPE} being defined
	before using it, for backwards compatibility with old specs.
2 September 2004: 1.4 Test for whether we got file flags results, set to
	"<undefined>" if we didn't.
24 August 2004: Moved file type assignment to separate subroutine.  Added
	new linktarget_type keyword.  Started tracking attributes of link
	targets, except for directory contents.
16 July 2004: 1.3 Fixed bug in check_file command to allow check_file for
	files that don't exist in the file system.  Fixed bug in
	FileAttr::compare that was causing deleted files to sometimes show
	up as added.
14 July 2004: Fixed bug in show_changes subroutine where it was attempting
	to display changed attributes via call to subroutine that requires
	a set as an argument, but supplying a tree.
10 June 2004: 1.2c Fixed bug created by OpenBSD 3.5's move of the
	location of sysctl from /usr/sbin to /sbin.
5 January 2004: 1.2b Fixed bug--stopped calling Digest::SHA1 on dirs
	since it's not supported.
8 April 2003: 1.2a Fixed bug in listing file attributes where special
	characters in file names need to be quoted (now that OpenBSD 3.3
	has a file with a space in its name in the default install).
26 February 2003: 1.2 Fixed bug in file writability check (when file doesn't
	exist), fixed references to directory of spec directories.
25 February 2003: Added better Linux support for file system attributes,
	allow -d paths relative to root_dir, special-cased -d secondary to
	not use PGP or immutable flags and to use a separate changed file.
23 February 2003: Added check for file writability for specifications
	before attempting to write to them.
22 February 2003: Made changes show list of changed attributes for
	each changed path.  Added "new" set code to valid_setlist and
	defined_set in preparation for adding the ability to initialize
	only new sets.  (Need to add code to automatically identify trees
	that don't have specs as members of "new", and to allow initialize
	to work for set new (and only set new) when immutable flags are
	used and securelevel is > 0.  There is a potential problem
	regarding specs for specs.)
22 January 2003: 1.1b Made a change to reset_changed_file.
9 January 2003: 1.1a Fixed bug in changed file support to allow -v support
	for "changes" command to work.
6 January 2003: 1.1 Added file system flags support.  Changed the behavior
	of the "exception:" field for directories (now counts just for the
	directory itself, not any files or directories under it) and added
	"exception-dir:" for the old behavior.  Added -v support to "changes"
	command (it now prints the details that "check" prints).  Allowed "."
	for "exception:" field.
3 March 2001: 1.05 Fixed GPG support and made it the default.
	Host setting will now respect case where no domain name
	is set (pretty much just cosmetic).
2 April 2000: 1.04 Added "ignore" keyword for files that aren't to be
	checked for changes, added "ignored" set in default config file.
28 March 2000: Modified to support chattr +i/-i for Linux immutable
	files.
12 February 2000: 1.03 Added additional documentation to README file.
	Modified Config to make sure that no trees are subtrees of other
	trees. 	Modified to check to make sure that at least one of the
	sets specified with the -s option has members (and warn about
	those that don't).  Added check_file command.  Fixed bug where
	no summary report would be printed if there were no changes,
	only additions or deletions of files.  Added changes command.
11 February 2000:  Modified to correct minor bug in reg exp that validates
	"tree:" fields in conf file.
6 February 2000: 1.02 Modified to correct "new nonexistent added" problem
	which occurred when a file was added after initialization (found
	at time of check) and deleted before update, and to fix problem
	where check summary report wouldn't list sets that had only
	additions and deletions but no changes.
5 February 2000: 1.01 Modified to check existence of files before using
	chflags (added set_immutable_flag subroutine), to record user
	when creating a spec or checking a tree.
30 January 2000:  Version 1.0 created from mtree.pl.
