# sigtree.conf file for macOS.
# Written 18 November 2017 by Jim Lippard, derived from 18 January 2000
# default sigtree.conf.
#
# By default, the config file goes in /etc/<hostname>.sigtree.conf.
# By default, the specs go in /var/db/sigtree.

# Optional crypto signing/verification for specs. Default is "none"
# (commented out), other options are "GPG" for GPG2, "GPG1" for GPG1,
# and "signify" to use signify (if somebody ports it to macOS).
#crypto_sigs: GPG
# Optional PGP key ID, for signing all specs.  Default is commented out.
# This option is disregarded for secondary specs (-d secondary).
#pgpkeyid: keyid

# Optional max and default number of children to fork.
#max_child_procs: 5
#default_child_procs: 4

# Optional use of system immutability flags to protect specs
# (requires going to single user mode to make changes).
# Default is no.  To use, set to yes, or, on BSD, to schg (same as
# "yes") for system immutability flags that can only be changed when
# securelevel=0, or to uchg, which has no securelevel restrictions.
# This option is disregarded for secondary specs (-d secondary).
immutable-specs: no

# Select Secure Hash Algorithm, SHA-2 and SHA-3 are supported.
# Default is SHA-3, 256 bits.
# SHA-2 supports 256, 384, or 512.
# SHA-3 supports 224, 256, 384, or 512.
# Options are:
# sha2_digest: N
# where N is 256, 384, or 512, or:
# sha3_digest: N
# where N is 224, 256, 384, or 512.
# Default changed from 256-bit SHA-2 to 256-bit SHA-3 on 10 October 2015.
# sha3_digest: 256
# Default previously switched from SHA-1 to SHA-2 (256-bit) as of
# 5 March 2005; recommendation was to switch to SHA-2 by 2010.
# Support for SHA-1 was removed at that time.

# Definitions of sets.
#
# Sets are used in several different ways.
#
# First, sets are used to group trees, so that different groups of
# trees may be initialized, checked, or updated by sigtree.  These
# operations are done on entire trees, so when used in this way,
# even exceptions are considered to be part of the same set as the
# tree they are part of.  Sets used only for this purpose do
# not have "keywords:" or "priority:" settings, and are known as
# secondary sets, but primary sets can also be used for this purpose.
#
# The -s argument to sigtree is used for specifying actions to
# be performed on a given set, using either a primary or secondary
# set, but it is important to note that it only matches *trees*
# that are members of the set, not exceptions within a tree.
# If you have an exception that belongs to a primary
# set that is not a set assigned to its tree, and try to check
# trees with -s <that-set>, that exception will not be checked because
# its tree will not be checked.  If, say, you want to be able to check
# all log files, you can only do that if every tree that contains log
# files has LOG as a set, which means you will have to check all of
# those trees (and not just the log files within them).  Sorry.
#
# Second, sets are used to determine which attributes of files are
# examined for changes.  There is no requirement that every part
# of a tree be the same in this respect.  The first set listed for
# a given tree or exceptional path of a tree is known as its
# primary set, and it is the set that determines what file attributes
# are checked (identified by the "keywords:" directive in a set
# definition) and what the priority level of the files is.
# Sets in this sense are known as primary sets.
#
# Syntax is:
# set: <longname>,<shortname> (Required.)
# description: <human-readable description of set> (Required.)
# keywords: <list of comma-separated mtree keywords to check> (Optional.)
# priority: <number indicating priority of reported discrepancies> (Optional.)
# Defaults:  keywords: all, priority: 0.
# Available keywords are gid,mode,nlink,shadigest,uid,size,link,mtime,ctime,type,linktarget_type,flags
# gid: group id of owner
# uid: user id of owner
# mode: access mode (permissions) flags
# nlink: number of hard links
# shadigest: the SHA-2 or SHA-3 digest, depending on which is selected
#   (former shadigest is still supported for backwards compatibility)
# size: size in bytes
# link: is this a link?
# mtime: modification time of file contents
# mtimestasis-NN[smhd]: modification time stasis--report if file hasn't
#        changed for more than NN seconds/minutes/hours/days.
# ctime: inode change time
# type: type of file (file, dir, link, device, etc.)
# linktarget_type: type of file that is target of a symbolic link
# flags: file system flags (arch, opaque, nodump, sappnd, schg, uappnd, uchg)
# (i.e., a subset of mtree keywords, with time split into mtime and ctime,
# and flags added).
# If you use immutable flags (schg) to protect system binaries, and regularly
# turn those on and off, you don't want your keywords to include ctime.

# List of pathnames identifying trees to produce specs for and a list
# of the sets they belong to.  The first set in a set list determines
# which keywords are set and report settings for the files in the tree.
# The exception directive is used to override the keyword and report
# settings for a particular file (it can be a directory) within the
# tree by making another set the primary set for the exception file
# (and its subtree, if it's a directory).  The exceptional file can
# still be a member of the parent set (and thus still be checked
# when that set is checked), but it need not be.  Exception path
# names must be relative to the tree root.
#    If an exception path is a directory, the primary set for that
# exception applies only to that directory, not to any other files
# under that directory.  If you want to make an exception for an entire
# subtree, you must use exception-tree instead of exception.
# Syntax:
# tree: <path>:<setlist>
# exception: <path>:<primary set>
# exception-tree: <dirpath>:<primary set>
