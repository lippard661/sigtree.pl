OVERVIEW

sigtree.pl is a tool for creating records of your filesystem structure
in order to detect unauthorized modifications to your system.  Its
records are called "specifications."  A specification is created for
a particular directory tree on your system, or, in some cases, for
a particular file.  Specifications are classified into sets, which
serve two functions.  First, you can choose which sets of trees you
want to create specifications for, which sets of trees you want to
check for changes, or which sets of trees' specifications you want
to update with detected changes.  Second, the primary set for each
tree determines a numeric priority level and a set of attributes
to be checked for changes.  The priority level is used for generating
summary reports of changes; higher priority items are listed first.

sigtree.pl uses pledge and unveil on OpenBSD, and can run with
privilege separation if you create a _sigtree user and group and
run it with -p or with "privsep: yes" in your config file.

INSTALLATION

sigtree.pl runs on OpenBSD, Linux (Debian/Proxmox), and macOS (at least),
and requires the following in order to work:

* Perl 5.
* CPAN Perl modules Digest::SHA, Sys::Hostname, Getopt::Std, File::Basename,
  File::Temp (or OpenBSD::MkTemp on OpenBSD), Cwd, and
  Storable (all included with OpenBSD standard distribution).
* CPAN Perl module Digest::SHA3.
* CPAN Perl module Parallel::ForkManager (1.19 w/OpenBSD or later).
* On OpenBSD, uses OpenBSD::Pledge, OpenBSD::Unveil, and OpenBSD::MkTemp.
* Privilege separation requires IO::Socket, IO::Handle, IO::Select,
  IO::FDPass, MIME::Base64, Privileges::Drop, and either JSON::MaybeXS
  or JSON::PP.
  Note that Privileges::Drop fails on macOS with the base perl installation
  included with Tahoe 26, but works fine with the latest perl install with
  Homebrew (or you can make a small patch to Privileges::Drop to make it
  workaround a bug in perl 5.34.1).

If signify signing is used (which is recommended), the following is also
required:

* Signify.pm (see below for where to obtain).
* signify (standard on OpenBSD) or signify-openbsd (Linux package).

If PGP signing is used, the following is also
required:

* PGP 5 or later, or GPG, or OpenBSD's signify (or Linux's
  openbsd-signify, or macOS's signify-osx), Signify.pm.
* CPAN Perl module PGP::Sign (security/p5-PGP-Sign port in OpenBSD).
* /bin/stty to turn off echoing when PGP passphrases are requested.

The default is none, GPG or signify are preferred. If you want to use
PGP 5 or later, make sure you set the variable PGP_or_GPG in sigtree.pl
to be 'PGP' instead of 'GPG' or set it in your config file.

If immutable flags are to be used, sigtree.pl requires:

* An operating system that supports immutable files (e.g., *BSD, Linux).
* /usr/bin/chflags for setting/unsetting immutable flags.
* /usr/sbin/sysctl to get the kernel securelevel.
OR (for Linux)
* /usr/bin/chattr for setting/unsetting the immutable file attribute.
* /usr/bin/lsattr for obtaining system file attributes.

To obtain CPAN Perl modules, it is recommended that you use the
standard CPAN module, obtained via OpenBSD ports tree, Homebrew,
apt, or manually as follows:

   perl -MCPAN -e shell;
   install Bundle::CPAN         (this includes Digest::SHA1)
   install Storable
   install PGP::Sign
   install Digest::SHA3
   install Parallel::ForkManager

The Signify.pm perl module may be obtained from either
   https://github.com/lippard661/Signify
 or
   https://www.discord.org/lippard/software

The recommended location for sigtree.pl is in /usr/local/bin.  Sigtree
configs go in /var/db/sigtree by default, but you can use any other
location, so long as you specify that location with the -r (root dir)
option to sigtree.pl. Sigtree-managed files are owned by root (even
with privilege separation; the unprivileged _sigtree user does not
have direct access).

The default config file name is <hostname>.sigtree.conf in your root dir,
but a different config file can be specified with the -c (config
file) option to sigtree.pl.  Modify the configuration file to
monitor directories and files that you want monitored, and prioritize
based on your own criteria.

The recommended mechanism for running sigtree tests is to use
a daily and weekly cron tab entry that emails the results to
another machine.  On *BSD machines, you can put the following
lines in daily.local and weekly.local, respectively:

(For daily but a full test on Wednesdays.)

    host=`/bin/hostname -s`
    dayofweek=`/bin/date +"%a"'
    changedfile="/var/db/sigtree/secondary/$host.changedsec"
    case $dayofweek in
        Wed) sigtreetest="daily,weekly"
	     ;;
	*) sigtreetest="daily"
	   ;;
    esac
    echo "Running sigtree $sigtreetest."
    /usr/bin/perl /usr/local/bin/sigtree.pl -d secondary -s $sigtreetest check | /usr/bin/mail -s "$sigtreetest $host secondary sigtree report" email-address
    test -f $changedfile && /usr/bin/perl /usr/local/bin/sigtree.pl -d secondary -s $sigtreetest update

(For a weekly full test.)

    host=`/bin/hostname -s`
    echo "Running sigtree weekly test."
    /usr/bin/perl /usr/local/bin/sigtree.pl check | mail -s "weekly $host sigtree report" email-address

Add the -v option if you want more verbose results that show the old
and new values of all file attributes that change.

These will cause a daily report of all new changes that occur each day
in files in the "daily" set and a check of the "weekly" set each
Wednesday for against the secondary specs, and update them, along with
a weekly report of all changes against the primary specification that
occur in any files in your config. The checks against the secondary
specs are updated immediately afterward, so changes detected won't
be reported again (except via the primary specs test).

COMMAND OPTIONS (from "sigtree.pl -h")

Usage: sigtree.pl [options] command
Options:
-r root_dir
-c config_file
-d spec_dir (absolute path or relative to root_dir)
-s set list ("new" is synonymous with "uninitialized" and can be used with
             the "initialize" command; you can specify multiple sets
	     separated by commas)
-f number of child processes (check, initialize)
-m don't show macOS application contents (but still process them)
-p use privilege separation
-v verbose
-V show version
-h help and version
Commands:
initialize: Initialize specifications for a set of trees.
initialize_specs: Initialize specification for the specification dir.
changes: Show non-updated or reinitialized changes found by check.
check: Check specifications for a set of trees.
check_file: Check an individual file against a specification.
   (The file name is specified on the command line after "check_file".)
check_specs: Check specification for the specification dir.
update: Update specifications with changes found by check.

The commands initialize_specs, check_specs, and check_file do not
take the -s option.

By default, the root directory is /var/db/sigtree and the
specification directory for each host is specs/<hostname> relative
to that root directory.  This is designed to allow you to rsync
your specs directories across multiple machines without name
conflicts.

Giving the argument "secondary" to the -d option is special-cased
to mean <root dir>/secondary/<hostname>, and to not use PGP signing
or immutable flags--unless you are using BSD, in which case the
secondary files use user immutability (uchg) if the immutable option
is turned on.

CONFIGURATION

The configuration file is divided into three sections--the global
attributes section, the set definition section, and the trees list
section.  Any line in the configuration file may be blank or a
comment (a line beginning with a # is a comment).  The configuration
file must end with a newline.

The global attributes section consists of the following:

    crypto-sigs: GPG|GPG1|PGP|signify
    pgpkeyring: path (default /root/.gnupg)
    pgpkeyid: keyid
    signify_pubkey: path
    signify_seckey: path
    immutable-specs: yes|no
    sha2_digest: 256|384|512
    sha3_digest: 224|256|384|512
    max_child_procs: [default 5]
    default_child_procs: [default 4]
    privsep: yes|no [default no]

All of these fields may be omitted. If the pgpkeyid: alone is used,
sigtree.pl will use GPG signatures on all specifications. It must
specify a PGP key ID which is in the keyring of the user running
sigtree.pl (usually root). The public key is required to do a check,
and access to the private key is required to do an initialize or
update.  Specify a crypto-sigs: field value to use GPG1, PGP, or
signify.  The pgpkeyring: field is optional and defaults to
/root/.gnupg.  The signify_pubkey: and signify_seckey: fields must be
specified if crypto-sigs: signify is used.

Signatures are checked against specifications during check commands,
and are generated from specifications during initialize and update
commands.

The immutable-specs: field may be omitted, in which case the default
is "no."  If it is set to "yes," then system immutability flags are
set on specifications (and PGP signatures, if used) after their
creation, and initialize and update commands then require booting
to single user mode so that the system secure level will allow the
flags to be reset so that the files may be changed.  On *BSD systems,
immutable-specs may be set to "schg" (equivalent to "yes") or to
"uchg"--system or user immutability, respectively.  "schg" means the
system must be in single-user mode to reset the flag. On *BSD systems,
enabling immutability will also enable user immutability on secondary
files.

The pgpkeyid: field is ignored when secondary specifications are used,
but if immutable-specs: are turned on (yes, schg, or uchg), then
user immutability will be used for secondary specifications
(-d secondary).

The default value for SHA digests if none is specified is 256-bit
SHA3. SHA2 or SHA3 digests are only generated and comparisons are only
performed if shadigest is specified in the keywords for a set. If you
initialize specifications without any shadigest specified in the
keywords and subsequently add it to the keywords, the next time you do
a check the associated files will show as having changed from
<undefined> to the current actual value.

The set definition section consists of any number of the following
fields used to define sets:

   set: long name,short name
   description: Human-readable description of set.
   keywords: list of keywords
   priority: priority level

The set: and description: fields are required; the keywords: and
priority: keywords are optional.  Set names may consist of up to
twelve alpha-numeric characters.  Hyphens may also be used in
set names.

Sets are used in two ways by sigtree.pl.  First, they are used
as a method of grouping trees, so that sigtree.pl's commands
may be used on different sets of trees.  The initialize, check,
and update operations work on entire trees.  The -s option to
sigtree.pl references sets used in this way; exceptions within
a tree are always members of the sets their tree is a member of.
The keywords: and priority: fields have no meaning for sets used
only in this way, and should not be defined for them.  The -s
option will complain about sets that are only used as primary
sets for exceptions, which have no trees as members.
  Second, sets are used to define groups of files that share
common characteristics, that need to have similar attributes
monitored for changes, and that are of a similar priority level.
The keywords: field determines which file attributes are checked
for changes, and the priority: field determines where changes
are reported in the check command's summary report--the higher
the priority, the higher it appears in the report.  Each tree or
exception may only have one set used in this way; this set is
known as its primary set and is the first one associated with
its name in the configuration file.
   Keywords available are

        type   type of file (file, dir, link, fifo, device, socket)
	linktarget_type  type of file that is the target of a link
        uid    user ID of owner
        gid    group ID of owner
        mode   file permissions
        size   size in bytes
        nlink  number of hard links to the file
        link   link target, if it's a symbolic link
        mtime  modification time of file
        mtimestasis-NN[smhd]  report if mtime doesn't change for
               more than NN seconds/minutes/hours/days
        ctime  inode change time of file 
        shadigest  SHA-3 or SHA-2 digest of file (the old sha2digest and
	       sha3digest keywords are now synonyms, the digests computed
	       are based on the global shaN_digest setting)
        flags  file system flags (those shown with ls -lo/set by chflags)
        ignore overrides all other keywords, no file attributes are
                  checked

and must be separated by commas in the keywords list.  If no
keywords: field is specified, the default is to check all of these
attributes except mtimestasis.

Priority must be a decimal integer.

The trees list section of the configuration file lists the pathnames
of trees for which specifications are to be produced and a list of
the sets they belong to.  The first set listed is the tree or file's
primary set and determines its priority and keyword settings.
   For each tree, any number of exception files within the tree may
be specified with a different primary set.  The exact syntax is:

    tree: path:set list
    exception: path:primary set
    exception-tree: dirpath:primary set

The "exception" field specifies a single file or directory as an
exception, while the "exception-tree" field specifies a directory
subtree (a directory and everything it contains) as an exception.
If "." is specified as an exception, the primary set of the tree
directory itself (but not its contents) is changed.  This is useful
for directories that frequently change mtime and ctime (like /etc).

Set names specified may be either long or short names of sets.

NOTES

Symbolic links are never followed by sigtree.pl, to avoid loops.
If you have a file you want monitored that is not under a specified
tree, but only the target of a symbolic link under a specified tree,
that file will not be monitored unless you add it or one of its
parent directories to the configuration file.

Symbolic and hard links are *referenced* via the ls command to
obtain immutable flags, which on OpenBSD will cause an unveil
violation if the referenced location is not a tree in the config
file.

Trees may not overlap--no tree in the configuration file may be a
subtree of another tree in the configuration file.
